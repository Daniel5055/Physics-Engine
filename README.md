Physics Engine
==============

This is a small physics engine I am working on. 

As of writing this readme, it is currently more a collision engine.

It was programmed with Java using Jswing.

In developing this program, I worked quite extensively with a representing my ideas with diagrams. The following diagram details design ideas about the different classes to be created as well as a flow diagram of the collision engine.
